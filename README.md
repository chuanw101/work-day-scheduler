A simple day scheduler. <br>
The time on the titles uses moment.js to get current time. <br>
The textarea color will change based on time, present = light red, past = light gray, future = light green. <br>
When clicking on text fields you can enter tasks. <br>
When SAVE button is clicked the task will be saved to localstorage and won't be lost on refresh. <br>
